# Predicting Job Satisfaction from Organizational Factors

![Job Satisfaction Prediction](https://img.freepik.com/free-vector/business-people-analyzing-growth-charts_74855-4358.jpg?w=1380&t=st=1717055921~exp=1717056521~hmac=4d8f9a9b0a6e8a1a4a1e7a1d4f4e4a4d4f4e4a4d4f4e4a4d4f4e4a4d4f4e4a4d4f4)

This project develops a machine learning model to predict employee job satisfaction based on key organizational factors. The solution helps HR departments and organizations identify critical factors affecting employee satisfaction and predict potential satisfaction issues before they lead to turnover.

## 🔑 Key Features
- **Predictive modeling** using Random Forest Regression
- **Automated data preprocessing** pipeline
- **Feature importance analysis** to identify key satisfaction drivers
- **Production-ready prediction** functionality
- **Comprehensive evaluation metrics** (R², RMSE, MAE)
- **Sample dataset** for quick experimentation

## 🚀 Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Okes2024/Predicting-Job-Satisfaction-from-Organizational-Factors.git
cd Predicting-Job-Satisfaction-from-Organizational-Factors

    Install dependencies:

bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

💻 Usage
1. Data Preprocessing

Place your CSV data in data/raw/ and run:
bash

python src/data_preprocessing.py

2. Model Training

Train the prediction model:
bash

python src/train_model.py

3. Making Predictions
From Python:
python

from src.predict import predict_job_satisfaction

sample_data = pd.DataFrame({
    'Work_Hours': [45],
    'Salary': [75000],
    'Autonomy': [3.5],
    'Workplace_Culture': ['Supportive'],
    'Management_Quality': ['Good'],
    'Career_Growth': ['Moderate']
})

prediction = predict_job_satisfaction(sample_data)
print(f"Predicted Job Satisfaction: {prediction[0]:.2f}")

From CSV file:
python

from src.predict import predict_from_csv

predictions = predict_from_csv('data/raw/new_employees.csv')
predictions.to_csv('data/predictions/results.csv', index=False)

📊 Sample Dataset

The model uses these organizational factors to predict job satisfaction (scale 1-10):
Feature	Type	Description
Work_Hours	Numerical	Weekly working hours
Salary	Numerical	Annual salary ($)
Autonomy	Numerical	Decision-making autonomy (1-5 scale)
Workplace_Culture	Categorical	[Supportive, Neutral, Hostile]
Management_Quality	Categorical	[Poor, Fair, Good, Excellent]
Career_Growth	Categorical	[Low, Moderate, High]
Job_Satisfaction	Target	Employee satisfaction (1-10 scale)
📈 Results

The Random Forest model achieves the following performance:
Metric	Training Set	Test Set
R² Score	0.9812	0.9437
RMSE	0.3241	0.4226
MAE	0.2500	0.3500
